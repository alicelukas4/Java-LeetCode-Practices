/**
 * Harvard CSCIE 160 
 * Homework Assignment HW1
 * Brian Ketelsen
 * <p>
 * Requirements:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create an Elevator class in the package cscie160.hw1. The class should have a no argument constructor that sets 
 * up the elevator's state.</li>
 * <li>Define several constant values in the Elevator class. Include the capacity and number of floors in the building.</li>
 * <li>Augment the Elevator with data members indicating the current floor and current direction of travel. Also add 
 * data members for both its destination requests and the number of passengers destined for each floor. [It's tempting 
 * to think that an Elevator can determine if a given floor is among its destinations just by checking to see if it 
 * has any passengers destined for the floor. But this will not stand up under the later requirement that an Elevator 
 * could be destined for a particular floor just to fetch passengers, while having none on board who are going there.]</li>
 * <li>Add a method move() to the elevator with the characteristic that every time it is called it increments or 
 * decrements the value of the current floor, according to whether the elevator is moving up or down, changing 
 * directions as appropriate.</li>
 * <li>Override the toString() method of java.lang.Object (the default base class of every Java class) in your 
 * Elevator class which returns a String object summarizing all the pertinent values in the elevator, including the 
 * number of passengers on board and the current floor. [The call to System.out.println() will accept any object as 
 * an argument and will look for a toString method for a means to create a String it can write to standard out. 
 * Thus, if Elevator is equipped with toString, then System.out.println(myElevator) will get a String from 
 * myElevator.toString() and send it to standard out.]</li>
 * <li>When the Elevator reaches a floor that is among its destinations it should stop, otherwise it should keep moving. 
 * Write the stop() method in such a way that it prints a message to standard out announcing the event of its stopping 
 * and have it send your Elevator to standard out after all processing for the stop is complete, i.e. after discharging 
 * passengers, to show its post-stop-processing state.</li>
 * <li>Stopping should entail appropriate changes in state. For instance, if an Elevator had two passengers destined 
 * for a particular floor, stopping there should clear the number of passengers destined there and the number of 
 * passengers on board should decrease by two and eliminate the floor as a destination of the Elevator. [The class 
 * Floor comes in the next homework so you needn't worry about what happens to the passengers after the Elevator stops.]</li>
 * <li>Endow your Elevator with a method, boardPassenger(int floor), for boarding a passenger destined for a particular 
 * floor. Calling this method should increase the number of passengers destined there by one, and should increase the 
 * number of passengers on board by one. [Note: this does not require defining a class Passenger.] For now, allow your 
 * elevator to fill beyond its capacity, accepting more passengers than it can hold. In homework 2, we will use an 
 * exception to handle this error case and limit the occupancy in the elevator.</li>
 * <li>Add self-documenting javadoc comments to your class. Run the javadoc utility on your class and submit the resulting 
 * HTML file, Elevator.html, with your work. If you are submitting hard copy, submit a printout from your browser 
 * displaying the html documentation for the class. [This requirement will apply to every homework during the course.]</li>
 * </ul>
